# Task Management App

A full-stack task management application showcasing microservices architecture, infrastructure as code, and modern DevOps practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project demonstrates a production-ready microservices architecture with:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for AWS resource provisioning
- **API Gateway**: Kong for authentication, rate limiting, and routing
- **Microservices**: Go-based auth and task services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper schema separation
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with TypeScript
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WilliamSchweitzer/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
```

### 2. Local Development Setup

```bash
# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
make migrate-up

# The app will be available at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Kong Gateway: http://localhost:8000
# - Kong Admin API: http://localhost:8001
```

### 3. Development Workflow

```bash
# Start individual services for development
cd services/auth-service
go run cmd/main.go

cd services/task-service
go run cmd/main.go

cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. Terraform installed locally
3. AWS CLI configured

### Deploy to AWS

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
cd terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev/terraform.tfvars"

# Apply infrastructure
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev/terraform.tfvars"
```

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## 📖 API Documentation

### Auth Service Endpoints

```
POST   /auth/signup     - Create new user account
POST   /auth/login      - Login and receive JWT tokens
POST   /auth/refresh    - Refresh access token
GET    /auth/verify     - Verify token validity
POST   /auth/logout     - Logout (invalidate refresh token)
```

### Task Service Endpoints

```
GET    /tasks           - Get all tasks for authenticated user
POST   /tasks           - Create a new task
GET    /tasks/:id       - Get specific task
PUT    /tasks/:id       - Update task
DELETE /tasks/:id       - Delete task
PATCH  /tasks/:id/complete - Mark task as complete
```

See [docs/api-spec.yaml](docs/api-spec.yaml) for complete OpenAPI specification.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific service tests
cd services/auth-service
go test ./...

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```
